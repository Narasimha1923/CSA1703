% Program written by Narasimha
% This program calculates the sum of integers from 1 to N.

% sum_to_n(N, Sum) is true if Sum is the sum of integers from 1 to N.
sum_to_n(0, 0).  % Base case
sum_to_n(N, Sum) :-
    N > 0,
    N1 is N - 1,
    sum_to_n(N1, Sum1),
    Sum is Sum1 + N.

% Start point of the program
start :-
    write('Program by Narasimha'), nl,
    write('Enter a number N: '),
    read(N),
    sum_to_n(N, Sum),
    format('Narasimha: The sum of integers from 1 to ~w is ~w~n', [N, Sum]).
